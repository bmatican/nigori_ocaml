\chapter{Evaluation} 
This section should detail the experiments and the requirements for them.
For now, I am considering both storage and speed tests.
Depending on if and when we manage to setup Mirage and Linux on the same machine, to do comparative testing, the list might shorten and impact might be placed on a specific part.

With the system running on Mirage, I would like to see if we can test all three combinations.
However, if all else fails, we can always just test the OCaml version against the Java version, for the same machine.
