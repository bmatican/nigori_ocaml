The story at the moment should be that of attempting to make a contribution in the realm of iterative protocol design.
This can be easily linked to the RFC and the contributions made back onto its continuous development.
Moreover, in the context of Nigori, this can also be expanded to cover the aspect of having the code deployed on multiple platforms that it is (specifically) compiled for.

Research motivation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Protocol design is inherently difficult
  \item Protocol implementations need to work across different environments and platforms
\end{itemize}
Research contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item theoretical and practical framework that allows for both fast prototyping and flexibility
  \item exemplification through chosen protocol / system: Nigori
\end{itemize}
