Designing a computer protocol is an inherently difficult task.
There are multiple aspects to be taken into account during the process of design and even moreso when considering what makes a protocol successful \cite{RFC5218}.
Nevertheless, there are certain
Backstory:
\begin{itemize}
  \item protocol design is inherently difficult, has many requirements \cite{ProtocolDesign}
  \item a successful protocol depends on many things (\cite{RFC5218})
  \item interoperability and flexibility are key requirements of a longlasting protocol
  \item getting a protocol to a good working state is a highly iterative process
  \item need a set of methods / techniques to help with fast prototyping (iterative design) while also offering high flexibility
\end{itemize}

Research contribution and what thesis contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item details of theoretical / practical considerations while analyzing a work--in--progress protocol: Nigori (give small description)
  \item key insights obtained through work
  \item practical implementation of system based on protocol specification
  \item results of iterative design and implementation process: a better overall protocol and system
  \item results of offering flexibility: targetting multiple platforms
\end{itemize}
