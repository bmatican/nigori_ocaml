Understanding RFC2898:
  "Here, INT (i) is a four-octet encoding of the integer i, most significant octet first." -- no example given.
  Assuming this means get the first four non-zero octets of an integer

  PRF(P, S) actually means HMAC_SHA1 with KEY=P and MESSAGE=S

Understanding Nigori spec:
  Section 1.4:
    In PBKDF2, PRF=SHA1 actually means PRF=HMAC_SHA1
    In EncDet, it is very unclear that F1 and F2 are the two halves of HMAC(K3, P)
